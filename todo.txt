- [x] seems module detection (via quickjs-run) always assumes script when there's a shebang line in the file
- [x] qjsbootstrap binaries are differing in size on linux aarch64
- [x] move "Module" global into "quickjs:module"

- [x] refactor "Module" object so that delegate stuff is separated from instance identification and Module.define
- [ ] get test262 stuff working and passing again
- [ ] TextEncoder and TextDecoder

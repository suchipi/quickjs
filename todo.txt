- [ ] pull in upstream changes: https://github.com/suchipi/quickjs/compare/main...bellard%3Aquickjs%3Amaster
- [x] seems module detection (via quickjs-run) always assumes script when there's a shebang line in the file
- [x] qjsbootstrap binaries are differing in size on linux aarch64
- [x] move "Module" global into "quickjs:module"
  - [x] mostly done, but module-impl is still in QJMS. Maybe that's fine?
- [x] refactor "Module" object so that delegate stuff is separated from instance identification and Module.define
- [ ] get test262 stuff working and passing again
- [ ] TextEncoder and TextDecoder

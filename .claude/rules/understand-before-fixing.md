# Understand Before Fixing

When debugging issues, **DO NOT stab in the dark with random changes**.

## Required Process

1. **Read the code carefully** - Understand what it's actually doing
2. **Trace the execution path** - Follow the actual flow, don't guess
3. **Identify the root cause** - Find the real bug, not symptoms
4. **Fix it properly** - Make targeted changes based on understanding

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Try random approaches without understanding
- ❌ Keep changing things hoping something works
- ❌ Make assumptions about what might be wrong
- ❌ Add workarounds for symptoms instead of fixing the cause

## What TO Do

- ✅ Read the relevant code thoroughly
- ✅ Trace the actual execution path
- ✅ Use debug output or logging to verify assumptions
- ✅ Understand WHY something is broken before changing it
- ✅ Make one targeted fix based on understanding

If you don't understand the code well enough to fix it confidently, say so and ask for help or clarification.

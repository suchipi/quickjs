# Research Conventions

When researching this codebase, save findings as rule files in `.claude/rules/research/`, following the conventions in `.claude/rules/claude-rules-conventions.md` (Markdown with YAML front matter containing a `paths` array of relevant glob patterns).

Filenames must include the current date (YYYY-MM-DD) at the time of creation, so that staleness can be detected later. For example: `2026-02-02-some-topic.md`.
